# to-do-list
Project: To-do list with Express / EJS
Project Summary: Simple To-do list using Node.js and the npm packages Express and EJS.

1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer
  ...1.1 If you don't have node.js installed you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download the GIT files for this project locally.
3. Open the files in your code editor (I prefer to use VS Code) and access the terminal from within your code editor.
4. Run npm init on your terminal - this will create a new file called packaged.json
5. Open packaged.json and underneath ' "main": "index.js" ', type ' "type": "module" '(to use ECMAScript Modules instead of CJS).
6. Run $npm i express (for PC) or %npm i express (for Mac) on your terminal
7. Run $npm i ejs (for PC) or %npm i ejs (for Mac) on your terminal
8. Run node index.js
9. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the To-Do list in action!

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
